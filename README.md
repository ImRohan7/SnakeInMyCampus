SnakeInMyCampus



I made this game in the memory of my first year in college. When I came to college in the first semester I came to know that
there were some snakes running in my campus between the way of J and M block.There were some warning signs too indicating to move 
carefully and watch out for snakes. It was a strange experience and a bit scary too. In the first year, most of our lectures were being 
held in M block. So, we had to go through that scary snake path multiple times in a day in order to attend lectures. In my second year, 
the muddy grass area was cleaned up and the problem solved but the memory remained in our brains forever !!! So, I tried to link that 
incident to this game :)
